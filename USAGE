This MATLAB codes compute 3-D seismic wavefield using BEM.
For homogenous model, run:

AstroSeis BEM_para

in MATLAB. For solid body with a liquid core model, run:

AstroSeis_liquidcore  BEM_para_lc

in MATLAB.Visualization is also embedded in this code. 
The input file can be the same with  the computation part. 
If the computation is finished, we can simply run 

AstroSeis_plot    BEM_para 

to do the plotting of the homogenous model. 
For the liquid core model is similar: 

AstroSeis_liquidcore_plot   BEM_para _lc

There are three examples that is already finished in "exmaples" folder. 
Usage is similar, you only need to change the input files.
